# Code Structure

## Overview
This codebase provides a Rust reference implementation of the Phenomenological Rendezvous protocol, with a focus on protocol logic, data structures, and simulation scaffolding.

## Modules
- `srt` - Symbolic Resonance Token encoding primitives.
- `pattern` - Submodality pattern definitions and helpers.
- `matching` - Pattern matching and rendezvous logic.
- `sim` - Simulation tools for testing rendezvous dynamics.
- `cli` - CLI scaffolding for future binaries.

## Out of Scope
This project does not implement real biosensor integrations, device firmware, or mobile apps. It focuses strictly on the protocol and its logic.
